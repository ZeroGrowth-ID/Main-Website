    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>December 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <p><strong>ZeroGrowth</strong> built the <strong>MonoTask</strong> app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
        ZeroGrowth at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
        Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>MonoTask does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information to external
            servers.</strong></p>
    <p>All data entered into the application (Tasks, Descriptions, Dates, etc.) is stored locally on your device using
        local database technologies (SQLite). This data remains exclusively in your control and is not accessible to
        ZeroGrowth or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>We want to inform you that unlike many other applications, MonoTask does not collect Log Data sent by your
        browser/device that would be transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>This Service does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use
        "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
        these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information (which is stored only locally), thus we strive to
        use commercially acceptable means of protecting it within the app's sandbox. But remember that no method of
        transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
        information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
        your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary
        actions.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
        any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 2025-12-25.</p>
